			<h3 id="project-introduction">Project introduction</h3>
<p>As I’ve started coding more collaboratively in academic and
professional contexts, I’ve learned that a deep understanding of version
control workflow is critical when working in teams.</p>
<p>In a solo project environment, git branches and logs mainly serve as
a historical record. This record is referenced as needed: maybe we need
to roll back certain changes, or figure out where a new bug was
introduced. However, when programming collaboratively, the git
repository and its related metadata is actually a critical mode of
communication between engineers. This goes beyond commit messages, which
should be clear and informative.</p>
<p>As an example, many teams using the feature branch workflow use pull
requests as a way to “talk” about changes to the codebase. One engineer
will check out a branch, say <code>feature-1</code>, update some code,
and file a pull request which will clearly show the diff between
<code>feature-1</code> and <code>master</code>. Then, IRL, the engineer
and his/her peers or manager will use the PR to discuss the changes to
the code before merging.</p>
<p>In this example, it is critical that the pull request captures a
reasonable set of changes, so as not to overwhelm the reviewer.
Additionally, <code>feature-1</code>’s commit history should be
straightforward and clear, and avoid clutter from minor updates.</p>
<p>It’s possible to get all these things right on the first pass, but
work can often get messy, and deep knowledge of version control
functionality can make it easy to clean up minor commits, merge or
rebase changes without polluting the commit history, and generally
streamline communication among the team.</p>
<p>With that in mind, learning version control is likely to make me a
more productive and collaborative engineer. And what better way to learn
than by building?</p>
<p>Hence the idea for this project - let’s build an implementation of
git in python! I’ll be sharing my work and learnings on this blog, and
will be heavily referencing James Coglan’s excellent book <em>Building
Git</em> as we seek to understand git’s inner workings.</p>
<h3 id="notes-on-approach">Notes on approach</h3>
<p>Since we’re building a version control system, let’s aspire to
self-host: all <code>pyle</code> code should be stored in version
control by <code>pyle</code> itself. As Coglan puts it, “the ultimate
goal is to build a program that can store and retrieve its own git
history, and push itself to a remote repository hosted on GitHub.”</p>
<h3 id="pyle"><code>pyle</code></h3>
<p>Why is the project named <code>pyle</code>? Well, first, since we’re
using python, our project name is essentially required to be a pun that
involves the letters <code>p</code> and <code>y</code>.
<code>pyle</code> is a take on the word <code>pile</code>, which
represents how I usually keep my working files on my physical desk…so
why not have a digital <code>pyle</code> for my code as well?</p>
