			<p>I'm currently pursuing a computer science master's degree at the University of Pennsylvania, with the goal of transitioning into the tech industry from financial services.</p>
			<p>I spent the last four years investing in innovative healthcare companies like <a href="https://www.dispatchhealth.com" target="_blank">Dispatch Health</a> and <a href="https://www.tytocare.com" target="_blank">TytoCare</a> as a venture capital investor at <a href="https://www.echohealthventures.com" target="_blank">Echo Health Ventures</a>.  Prior to my time at Echo, I helped the country's largest healthcare systems raise capital and execute strategic M&A activity as a member of <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com" target="_blank">J.P. Morgan</a>'s healthcare investment banking group.  I completed my undergraduate education at Penn in 2014, earning a B.S. in Economics from Wharton and a B.A. in Political Science from the College of Arts and Sciences.</p>

			<p>I'm open to professional opportunities (including consulting and advisory engagements) where I can leverage my growing technological skillset, finance/investing background, and deep knowledge of the healthcare industry to add value to early- and growth-stage companies.  I'm located in Seattle, so if you're in town, I'd be happy to meet over coffee &ndash; but am happy to discuss remote arrangements as well. If you're interested in exploring opportunities to collaborate, please reach out: matt.parmett / gmail.com.</p>

			<p>Outside of work, I enjoy building (and shopping for) hifi kit, collecting records, homebrewing, and amateur photography.  <!-- Feel free to explore my photos from <a href="copenhagen.html">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="stockholm.html">Stockholm</a>, <a href="berlin.html">Berlin</a>, <a href="israel.html">Israel</a>, and <a href="lisbon.html">Lisbon</a>. --></p>
